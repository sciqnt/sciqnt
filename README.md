# sciqnt

**A local-first, agent-native portfolio tracker & cross-asset financial data
layer.** One canonical, point-in-time-correct schema for your positions,
transactions, cash and prices — fed by community connectors for each broker
/ exchange / data source, rendered in a fast TUI, and consumable by any AI
agent (Claude Code, Codex, …) through plain CLI + versioned JSON surfaces.

Deterministic code computes the numbers. Agents reason and explain. You own
every byte: your credentials live in your OS keyring, your data on your
disk — there is no server.

*That's the built-in demo portfolio — synthetic and deterministic. sciqnt
runs in demo mode until you connect an account; no real finances appear in
any screenshot or doc, ever.*

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sciqnt/sciqnt && cd sciqnt
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install pydantic prompt-toolkit keyring
./bin/sciqnt install        # adds `sciqnt` to your PATH
sciqnt                      # the interactive home (demo portfolio until you connect)
```

PyPI packages (`uv tool install sciqnt`, `pip install sciqnt-degiro`, …) are
coming with the first tagged release. macOS note: use a Python built
against modern OpenSSL (e.g. Homebrew `python@3.13`) — the system Python's
LibreSSL is fragile against financial-API TLS.

## What you get

- **The TUI**: portfolio home with net-worth chart (1D…All ranges,
  5-minute intraday), positions / exposure / income / news / flows /
  history tabs, account drill-downs — everything keyboard-driven.
- **Honest money math**: `Decimal` end-to-end, FIFO/LIFO/AVG lots,
  fees-inclusive cost basis, TWR (GIPS-style breaks), XIRR, max drawdown,
  benchmark comparison — computed from your raw transaction history,
  point-in-time-correct (`sciqnt --asof 2024-12-31`).
- **Connectors as self-contained bundles** (`modules/sq-*`): manifest +
  agent-facing SKILL + a living quirks log (FINDINGS) + conformance tests.
  Degiro (CSV + live), Robinhood, Kalshi, Polymarket, Yahoo, Tiingo, ECB
  FX, SEC EDGAR, FIRDS, OpenFIGI, RSS news — and a scaffold + harness for
  building your own.
- **Agent-native, both directions**: every view is reproducible from the
  CLI (`sciqnt --help` maps it; `--json` gives versioned, Decimal-as-string
  data — `sciqnt.portfolio/v1`, `sciqnt.history/v1`, …). Summon your coding
  agent from any screen and it receives where you are, what's on your
  screen, and the command that reproduces it; agents can leave findings on
  your home screen (`sciqnt insight add`).
- **A point-in-time price archive**: append-only, bitemporal, yours.

## For agents

Run `sciqnt --help`. Every screen of the app has a CLI form; add `--json`
for structured data. Skills ship in-repo (`sq-portfolio`, `sq-connectors`)
and install into Claude Code / Codex automatically when summoned from the
app. **[`AGENTS.md`](AGENT_GUIDE.md) is the codebase map — start there if
you're an agent.**

## Build a connector for your broker

The platform ships the contract + conformance harness + a scaffold — the
long tail of connectors belongs to the community (and to your coding
agent). See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md); the short version:

```
"build a sciqnt connector for <my broker>"   # tell your coding agent
```

Independent connector repos install with `sciqnt modules add owner/repo`
(conformance runs locally before first use — trust is earned by the
harness, not claimed).

## Going deeper

- [`FOUNDATION.md`](FOUNDATION.md) — the worldview + the 13 Founding Articles.
- [`PRINCIPLES.md`](PRINCIPLES.md) — the 18 operating principles.
- [`research/`](research/) — the grounded reasoning behind every decision.

Principles, the short list: local-first and sovereign — fire us and keep
everything. Deterministic core, probabilistic edge — LLMs never touch the
money math. Data first — rendered text is for humans, versioned JSON is the
contract. Read wide, execute gated. Synthetic fixtures only.
